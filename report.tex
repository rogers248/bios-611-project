\section{Introduction}

Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift.This sport is getting more and more popular around the world. So I decided to start this project to get deeper understanding about powerlifting. The dataset is a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting database as of 2015 to 2019. OpenPowerlifting is an organization which tracks meets and competitor results in the sport of powerlifting, in which competitors complete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate weightlifting categories. I'm using the data from it to make some data analysis in the powerlift field recently.

\section{Data Source}

The dataset with variable descriptions and more context can be found \href{https://www.kaggle.com/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database}.

\section{Data Visualization and Analysis}

\subsection{Country and Meets}

We can see from the picture that in our chosen years, USA,Norway,Canada,Australia and New Zealand hold powerlifting meets a lot. And USA, as the origin country of the powerlifting sports, definitely hold meets most, 3894 times. 


\subsection{Weight Class for Men and Women}

From the barplot for men, the top 3 common weight class are 100kg,90kg and 110kg, which means weight class around 100kg is more popular for powerlifting. From the barplot for women, the top 3 common weight class are 67.5kg, 75kg and 60kg, which means class around 67.5kg is more popular among women. 
If we take consideration of average weight in US, the average weight of American men in 2015-16 was 89kg; for women, it was 77kg. So most of the male powerlifters are heavier than average while most female powerlifters keep ordinary weights.

\subsection{Common Division}

When we are looking at the different divisions for meets, we can take example from men's data. The result shows that the Open Division include over 90% men athletes.

\subsection{Wilk: Highest Wilk for Men and Women}

The Wilks coefficient or Wilks formula is a mathematical coefficient that can be used to measure the relative strengths of powerlifters despite the different weight classes of the lifters. It's one of the most important reference for ranking in powerlifting meets. From the wilk ranking barplots for men and women, the best wilk for men is 609 and the best wilk for women is 621. And in the data range we chose, we have 4 female powerlifters' wilk over 600 and 2 male powerlifters' wilk over 600.
Though we know most of the situations men and lift much heavier than women at the same weight class, the result shows that women have better wilk coefficient.
